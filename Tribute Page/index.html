				About the Legend
			</h1>
<p>
			  <ul> <li> A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
				Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
				was born on October 15, 1931, in
				Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br></li></ul>
                <ul> <li>He served as the 11th President
				of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br></li></ul>
				<ul> <li> Kalam earned a degree in
				aeronautical engineering from the
				Madras Institute of Technology and in
				1958 joined the Defence Research and
				Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br></li></ul>
				<ul> <li>Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
				Kalam planned the program that produced
				a number of successful missiles, which
				helped earn him the nickname <strong>
				“Missile Man.”</strong><br><br></li></ul>
				<ul> <li> Among those successes
				was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
				ballistic missile, which incorporated
				aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
				in 1989.<br><br></li></ul>
				 <ul> <li>He also played a
				pivotal organisational, technical,
				and political role in India's Pokhran-II
				nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
				the original nuclear test by India in 1974.<br><br></li></ul>
				<ul> <li>His prominent role in
				the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
				solidified India as a nuclear power and
				established Kalam as a national hero,
				although the tests caused great concern
				in the international community.<br><br></li></ul>
				<ul> <li>In 1998 Kalam put
				forward a countrywide plan called
				Technology Vision 2020, which he described
				as a road map for transforming India from
				a less-developed to a developed society
				in 20 years. The plan called for, among
				other measures, increasing agricultural
				productivity, emphasizing technology as
				a vehicle for economic growth, and
				widening access to health care and
				education.<br><br> </li></ul>
				<ul> <li>Kalam received <b>7</b>
				honorary doctorates from <b>40</b>
				universities. The Government of India
				honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan
				in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan
				in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and
				DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor
				to the Government.<br><br></li></ul>
				<ul> <li>While delivering a
				lecture at the Indian Institute of
				Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
				died from an apparent cardiac arrest on
				<b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.<br><br></li></ul>
                <ul> <li> Wheeler Island, a
				national missile test site in Odisha, was
				renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in September
				2015.<br><br></li></ul>
                <ul> <li> On 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest 
                at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state honours.
                Over 350,000 people attended the last rites, including the Prime Minister, 
                the governor of Tamil Nadu and the chief ministers of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.<br><br></li></ul>
                <ul> <li>The Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam National Memorial[118] was built in memory of Kalam by the DRDO in 
                Pei Karumbu, in the island town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. It was inaugurated by Prime Minister 
                Narendra Modi in July 2017.<br><br></li></ul>
